                <p>Welcome to my chaotic, thrown together, I have no idea what to name it with three braincells of a website. Essentaily what I'm trying to tell you is welcome to my head.</p>
                <img class="img-brain" src= "img/braindead.png" alt="Naiko_braindead">
                <p> On this site, we are going to talk about my project to submit as my final project by the end of the course. So sit back, relax and enjoy the show.</p>
                
                <p> During our first lesson, I had an idea. I made a note on my phone on the way home about my brainstorm and what I wanted to or plan to make. This is my first drafting of an idea which might change in the future. </p>

                <p> Initially the idea was an LED screen, showing time, weather, season...etc. This mini screen can be used as a table side decoration or can be used in the lobby of hotels for example as an aesthetic or a way of informing. I wanted to first create an alarm clock of sorts, table accessory which intergrates a system that changes gifs base on timing. I would also like to add in another option of being able to connect other similar devices through physical contact therefore eliminating the usage and the headache to for cable management.</p>
